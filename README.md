## Use

This project uses CocoaPods for its dependencies.
It is required to open 'Eatr.xcworkspace' instead of 'Eatr.xcodeproj' to work on this project, as otherwise the dependencies will not be included in your local project.

While this repository already has the Pods preinstalled, it is recommended to install CocoaPods in case you wish to update any dependencies.

To install CocoaPods input the following command in Terminal:
```
$ sudo gem install cocoapods
```

Then, browse to the project's directory and install the Pods with the following command:
```
$ pod install
```
